In addition to the quake, which shifted parts of the country’s coast eight feet, Japan is also facing the potential meltdown of nuclear reactors that were damaged.<break type="paragraph" />The disaster in Japan has already begun to influence the international community. Fears of nuclear radiation persist, causing stocks to fall. Several countries are providing support to Japan in the form of supplies, monetary aid and manpower. As Japan begins the long road to recovery, we as a community must commit ourselves to supporting a nation that has strong links to the University.<break type="paragraph" />Safety concerns in the aftermath of the earthquake prompted Duke’s International Travel Oversight Committee to halt all travel to Japan Tuesday. Duke students currently in Japan are being moved out of the country.<break type="paragraph" />While it is easier to see the effect the earthquake will have on students studying abroad, the impact on students in Durham should be noted. Counseling and Psychological Services as well as the International House have extended support to students who are from Japan or have relatives there, and campus organizations are planning philanthropic projects to provide relief.<break type="paragraph" />In an e-mail sent to the student body Tuesday evening, Vice President for Student Affairs Larry Moneta announced the creation of japanrelief.duke.edu—a clearinghouse page that will inform the student body about current events. This webpage will provide “information about relief organizations active in the region, campus resources for students in need, as well as fundraising and other relief-related events.” This website is a positive step toward student involvement in this crisis.<break type="paragraph" />As the home of more than 120 million people, Japan is a thriving industrial nation. Due to its location the country frequently experiences earthquakes and has taken precautions to minimize damage. Economic stability, along with preparedness, has limited overall damage to the country. This diligent preparation separates the earthquake in Japan from the recent quake in Haiti and the flooding in Pakistan, where a lack of preparation, poor government structure, and widespread poverty combined to create devastating conditions, the effects of which are still seen today.<break type="paragraph" />These factors should not mitigate our commitment to aid—the situation in Japan is dire and must not be understated. According to the public broadcaster NHK, at least 300,000 people are living in shelters following the destruction of their homes. Death is a daily occurrence and thousands of people are still missing.<break type="paragraph" />As a campus, we can find ways to help. In the coming weeks, several fundraisers for Japanese relief will take place, providing ample opportunities for students to assist. Donations to the American Red Cross and other charitable organizations are encouraged. Students are also invited to attend a candlelight vigil tonight at 8 p.m. on the steps of the Chapel.<break type="paragraph" />Japan will be able to recover from this disaster, but external support will speed its regrowth. With full campus involvement, Duke can help provide the aid Japan so desperately needs. </text><metadata><name>Article Type</name><value><string></string></value></metadata><metadata><name>Chars</name><value><integer>3334</integer></value></metadata><metadata><name>Words</name><value><integer>525</integer></value></metadata><metadata><name>Lines</name><value><integer>125</integer></value></metadata><metadata><name>Copyfit</name><value><integer>0</integer></value></metadata><type>incx</type></textObject><textObject><id>64135</id><text>[please enter tags here separated by commas, e.g. “column, monday monday, dsg, brodhead”]</text><metadata><name>Article Type</name><value><string></string></value></metadata><metadata><name>Chars</name><value><integer>89</integer></value></metadata><metadata><name>Words</name><value><integer>13</integer></value></metadata><metadata><name>Lines</name><value><integer>3</integer></value></metadata><metadata><name>Copyfit</name><value><integer>-47</integer></value></metadata><type>incx</type></textObject></textObjects></article></issue></publication></k4Export>

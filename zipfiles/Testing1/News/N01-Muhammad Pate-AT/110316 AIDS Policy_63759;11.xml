Medicaid does not currently fund transportation, she added, so the project will aim to find solutions for patients who need funds to travel for treatment.<break type="paragraph" />To ensure continued funding for HIV and AIDS patients, the project hopes to work with legislatures to ensure equal rights for patients of the disease as well as continue state subsidized treatment for those who cannot afford it, McAllaster said. The AIDS Drug Assistance Program, for example, provides critical drugs to low-income HIV patients but faces a budget shortfall that has prompted political debate over the program.<break type="paragraph" />“There are people such as [State Representative] Larry Brown who hope to cut state funding to this program,” she said. “We are for the first time in 100 years working with a Republican controlled legislature, but [Congressional] Senator [Richard] Burr, also a Republican, is a strong supporter of ADAP, so we have hope that we can work with them in making policy recommendation when the health care reform is carried out.”<break type="paragraph" />North Carolina is one of 11 states with waiting lists for HIV and AIDS treatment, according to the North Carolina AIDS Action Network website. Last year, ADAP was closed to new enrollees due to a lack of funding, resulting in the longest waiting list in the country, McAllaster added.<break type="paragraph" />“ADAP is one of the programs that is extremely important in the fight against AIDS in that it offers life-saving medication,” said Ian Palmquist, executive director of Equality North Carolina, an organization which aims to ensure legal and judicial equality for HIV and AIDS patients. “If we cut funding to it then people will go without treatment and die. It would also run the risk of creating vaccine immune virus strands, which is dangerous because the number of vaccines out there is already limited.”<break type="paragraph" />Education about the disease and confidentiality laws­ is vital to reduce discrimination, McAllaster noted. One of AIDS Legal Project’s new policy’s steps will be to lead legal education seminars in North Carolina.<break type="paragraph" />Negative connotations and prejudice has been widely regarded as the single greatest challenge facing HIV and AIDS patients, Palmquist said. He attributed a large part of this to “careless breaches” in confidentiality.<break type="paragraph" />“There was a case when a woman, acting as a character witness for her son, revealed to their lawyer her HIV positive status,” McAllaster added. “When put on the stand, the lawyer announced it to the whole court with the intention of getting sympathy.”<break type="paragraph" />McAllaster said these mistakes are not made maliciously, but the repercussions are potentially dangerous for the patient.<break type="paragraph" />“Yes, it has gotten easier for people to be honest about their status, but it is still a risky leap of faith to take,” said Sherryl Broverman, associate professor of the practice of biology who has spent time studying the disease in North Carolina and Kenya. “People have gotten fired from jobs, rejected from their families, suffered depression and kicked out of their apartments when society finds out the truth.”</text><metadata><name>Article Type</name><value><string></string></value></metadata><metadata><name>Chars</name><value><integer>4359</integer></value></metadata><metadata><name>Words</name><value><integer>704</integer></value></metadata><metadata><name>Lines</name><value><integer>99</integer></value></metadata><metadata><name>Copyfit</name><value><integer>-1</integer></value></metadata><type>incx</type></textObject><textObject><id>63761</id><text>2.
